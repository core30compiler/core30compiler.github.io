		 	<b> INTRODUCTION </b>
		</td>
		<td> <p class="gray"> To break every limitation that we in the implementation of a language may encounter and therefore to be able to create any type of language, an extension of its architecture that we have called architecture 4.0 has been designed for the Core 3.0 compiler. The Core 3.0 Compiler Language in fact allows you to do 90% of things and to do them in a fast and automatic way. For the remaining 10% for various reasons, including compilation speed, we have to get our hands in the compiler source code. Architecture 4.0 is a partially implemented architecture that is waiting to be completed in its specialization for the purpose of fully implementing a new programming language.</p>
	 <p class="gray"> From this point of view and through the implementation of the remaining part of the 4.0 architecture, everything that other languages ​​and compilers do is made possible, in short, from the definition of variables to strict typing.</p>

			 	<b> POSSIBILITIES </b>

			<p class="gray"> any type of data (primary and derivated types)</p></li> <li> <p class="gray">defining any type of scope</p></li><li><p class="gray"> any function and types of call to it</p></li><li><p class="gray"> any kind of expression processing or translation</p></li></ul>

				 	<b> DISCUSSION </b>
				</td>
				<td> <p class="gray">The only limit to semantics is given by the possible unfamiliarity of the APIs made available by the operating system or by the impossibility of accessing these except with particular compilers.  </p>
				<p class="gray"> Conversely, if you own a programmable architecture and you want a new language and you have and know how to do anything with your hardware or with your proprietary API, both theoretically and practically there are no limits.
