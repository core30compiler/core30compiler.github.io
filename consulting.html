<p class="gray"> <b> Consulting </b> </p>
<p class="gray"> The consulting service is based on your willingness to undertake a research and development period directly with the creator of the Core 3.0 Compiler, the Engineer G. Alestra. He will works in contact with people from your company, implementing the solution you asked for.
</p>
<p class="gray"> <b> He offers </b> </p>
<p class="gray"> A complete consultancy aimed at improving software development times and methods through the adoption of the all-purpose Core 3.0 compiler in its specialization for the creation of a programming language that is the one you have commissioned.
</p>
<p class="gray"> <b> He asks </b> </p>
<p class="gray"> A Contract and Collaboration in the development and engineering process of the programming language. It is also required that collaborators must have a strong problem solving ability, as well as strong motivation in the success of the work.
</p>
<p class="gray"> <b> He gives </b> </p>
<p class="gray"> An executable file (result of the implementation work) that represents the compiler's specialization for engineered language. He does not provide the Core 3.0 compiler. He does not provide the compiler open to building frameworks. He does not even provide the framework open to possible modifications. He provides the language that is translated into business solutions as it is engineered.
 </p>
<p class="gray">For any changes to the language and the framework, there must be a collaboration, for skills and professionalism. This is desiderable for top notch results.
