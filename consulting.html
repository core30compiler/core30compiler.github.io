<p class="gray"> <b> Consulting </b> </p>
<p class="gray"> Our consulting service is based on your willingness to undertake a research and development period with us. We are open to companies that already do research and development or who want to start doing it.
</p>
<p class="gray"> <b> We offer </b> </p>
<p class="gray"> We therefore offer complete consultancy aimed at improving software development times and methods through the adoption of the all-purpose Core 3.0 compiler in its specialization for the creation of a programming language that is the one you have commissioned.
</p>
<p class="gray"> <b> We ask </b> </p>
<p class="gray"> We ask that the development and engineering process of a programming language be done in collaboration between us and the client company. In fact, we need someone to provide us with application examples, working pieces of code and collaborate with us in the process of creating the language. It is also required that collaborators must have a strong problem solving ability, as well as strong motivation in the success of the work.
</p>
<p class="gray"> <b> We give </b> </p>
<p class="gray"> We will deliver an executable file that represents the compiler's specialization for engineered language. We do not provide the Core 3.0 compiler. We do not provide the compiler open to building frameworks. We do not even provide the framework open to possible modifications. We provide the language that is translated into business solutions as it is engineered.
 </p>
<p class="gray">We believe in continuous and beneficial partnerships. In fact, for any changes to the language and the framework, our participation, for our skills and our professionalism, is desirable.
