	<p class="gray">The author of Core 3.0 from the conceptual ideation, to the analysis, to the project, and to the complete implementation is the engineer Giovanni Alestra, who since the period of university studies, fascinated by the simplicity of all-purpose languages, such as BASIC , having identified the problem of the lack of being able to create an ad-hoc programming language for their own implementation solutions, strongly believing in personal initiative, and in the possibility of solving the aforementioned problem, in five years, of personal research and development work , led to the birth of the Core 3.0 compiler. </p>
	<p class="gray"> He received his degree in computer engineering in 2012 at the University of Pisa after a period of study that also saw him engaged in extracurricular studies.
</p>

	<ul>
 <li>
 			<p class="gray" > Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at Pisa University (Italy) </p>
</ul>
<p class="gray"> Given his high predisposition towards innovation and his vast knowledge of information technologies at 360 degrees in 2013 he began his studies at the information engineering department as a Ph.D student.

<li>
			<p class="gray" > Ph.D Student Dept. Information Engineering of Pisa University (Italy) (2013-2014 title not achieved) </p>
		</li>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="gray"> But he failed to obtain the Ph.D degree and dropped out of his studies after a year for his attidutine in search of solutions to global problems.
</p>
<p class="gray"> Having also work experience, which we do not report because we consider it of little relevance, he identified the need for an innovative tool such as Core 3.0 and after a period spent in the design of the system, he consciously launched himself into the implementation of the project that saw him engaged in 5 years of personal analysis, design and implementation work.

		</li>
</ul>
<p class="gray"> Ever since it was implementatively possible, the Core project has been subjected to testing and carrying out case studies. We can say that since 2017, it has been possible for him to gain experience in the implementation with Core and in the development of working frameworks and therefore also of programming languages.

		</li>
</ul>
<p class="gray"> From 2020, after a short rest period of a few months, he began the profession of R&D Consultant for the adoption of Core 3.0 and for the Realization of Programming Languages and therefore of Framework for the compiler.

		</li>
</ul>
<p class="gray"> His skill and extreme professionalism in programming derive from the fact that he started programming since the age of 8. By nature he is a thinker. We could call him a philosopher. His predisposition to thinking leads him to prefer the analysis phase to that of implementation. According to him, more time must be devoted to analysis. If the analysis is perfect, the implementation time is extremely reduced and everything becomes simple.
